This folders primary goal is to help in the creation of Haar Cascades.
It does not contain the training data as these files are too large.

The "label_maker_and_cropper" is used to hand label photos either from 
a web cam or photos from a file. This will create an lst file containing
the labels and it will also crop the images to be used with OpenCV_createsamples

The "photo_downloader" is used to download negative images from urls. The URLs
currently in this folder (found in "photo_downloader/urls/negative_urls" were 
obtained from image-net.org.

The "random_neg_rename" is used to rename already downloaded photos to allow a 
wider range of negative photos to be used with OpenCV_createsamples when creating
multiple samples. OpenCV_createsamples uses the same negative image names each 
time it is used from my experience.

The "create_cumulative_lst_file" is the last folder to be used before creating the
.vec file. To use this folder, place all positive labeled image folders into this folder
and run the script. The .lst files for each respective positive set should be contained
within the respective folder and contain only the positive image name. The master_label
folder that is created is what is to be used to create the .vec file.

Ultimately the actual OpenCV_createsamples and OpeCV_traincascade will have to be
obtained from the OpenCV github https://github.com/opencv/opencv
If you compile OpenCV from source using Cmake and Visual Studios (which is how I did it)
the OpenCV_createsamples.exe and OpeCV_traincascade.exe and the necesary dll can be found
within the folder it was compiled to.
