Please read the following python guidelines
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

The following are some guidelines we aim to follow in this project

Variables:
	1) should be no less than 3 characters
	2) must clearly represent what they stand for
		a) Example: use "TaxRate" not "TR"
	3) should start with lower case letters
	4) can be more than one word but they must be stuck together using an underscore
			- Example: two_words
			
Comments:
	1) should always start your program
		a) Starting comment should give:
			- Name of author
			- Organization (MSU)
			- Description of what the program does
	2) should be placed before each block of your program
	3) should be place when ever there is doubt
		a) for example if it is unclear why you are doing something
	4) should be clear and descriptive (not generic)
		- Good: #Print paychecks for 100 employees
		- Bad:  #Print
	
Note: Try to keep lines of code bellow 78 characters

Order of program:
	1) Start Program with comment:
		Programmerâ€™s name
		Organization (Midwestern State University)
		Description of programs functions
		
		Example:
			#Kuwin Wyke
			#Midwestern State University
			#Program to print the square root of a number after two seconds
			
			OR
			
			"""
			Kuwin Wyke
			Midwestern State University
			Program to print the square root of a number after two seconds
			"""

	2) 	Import necessary libraries
		Place each import on a seperate line
		Example:
			import math
			import time
			
	3) Declare global variable (variables accessible by the whole program) 

	4) Declare functions (main function first)
		Put function in chronological order 
			(functions that call another function should be placed after said function with the exception of main)
		Declare all local variables at the start of the function

	5) Place main program in a function called main and then call that function

	Sample program:

		#Kuwin Wyke
		#Midwestern State University
		#Sample program to print the square root of a number after two seconds.
		
		import math
		import time
		
		#Main function to perform primary function of the program.
		def main():
			#Time to wait before printing answer.
			WaitTime = 2
			Number = 4
			time.sleep(WaitTime)
			print(GetSqrRoot(Number))
				
		#Function to get the square root of a given number.
		def GetSqrRoot(Num):
			Num = math.sqrt(Num)
			return Num
		
		#Check to see if the program is not being called by an external function.
		#If an external program is calling on this function for access to the 
		#functions in this program then  this block will not be executed.
		if __name__ == "__main__":
			main()
