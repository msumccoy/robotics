Variables:
	1) should be no less than 3 characters
	2) must clearly represent what they stand for
		a) Example: use "TaxRate" not "TR"
	3) should always start with a capital letter
	4) can be more than one word but they must be stuck together
		a) Variables with more than one word must have each first letter capitalized
			- Example: TwoWords
			
Comments:
	1) should always start your program
	2) should be placed before each block of your program
	3) should be place when ever there is doubt
		a) for example if a methodology is unclear
	4) should be clear and descriptive
		- Good: #Print paychecks for 100 employees
		- Bad:  #Print
	
Note: Try to keep lines of code bellow 80 characters

Order of program:
	1) Start Program with comment:
		Programmer’s name
		Organization (Midwestern State University)
		Date of commencement - Date of completion (if not completed put “in progress”)
		Description of programs functions
		
		Example:
			#Kuwin Wyke
			#Midwestern State University
			#September 9, 2019 - in progress
			#Program to print the square root of a number after two seconds

	2) 	Import necessary libraries
		Place each import on a seperate line
		Example:
			import math
			import time
			
	3) Declare global variable (variables accessible by the whole program) 

	4) Declare functions
		Put function in chronological order 
			(functions that call another function should be placed after said function)
		Declare all local variables at the start of the function

	5) Place main program in a function called main and then call that function

	Note: While it is legal to call of a function that is declared later in the program, this is bad practice.

	Sample program:

		#Kuwin Wyke
		#Midwestern State University
		#September 9, 2019 - in progress
		#Sample program to print the square root of a number after two seconds.
		
		import math
		import time
		
		#Time to wait before printing answer.
		#This variable is accessable to the entire program (global).
		WaitTime = 2
		
		#Function to get the square root of a given number.
		def GetSqrRoot(Num):
			Num = math.sqrt(Num)
			return Num
		
		#Main function to perform primary function of the program.
		def main():
			#Number is only accessable to the main function (local)
			Number = 4
			time.sleep(WaitTime)
			print(GetSqrRoot(Number))
		
		#Check to see if the program is calling it self.
		#If an external program is calling on this function for access to the 
		#functions in this program then  this block will not be executed.
		if __name__ == "__main__":
			main()
